### Planned

- More units — grenadier, ranger, mortar, humvee, tank
- Custom maps and scenarios
- Customizable rules (make your own game!)
- Multiplayer — up to 4 players; hot seat (local) and play by URL sharing over email and chat
- App server free design (immune to shutdown, able to run locally)
- Completely open source code base written in ClojureScript
- Support for AI bots written in JavaScript and ClojureScript
- Reference AI implementations in JavasScript and ClojureScript
- Game logic decoupled from user interface (implement your own interface if you want!)

### Considering

- Air and sea units
- Fog of war
- Tunable parameters for the stock AI
